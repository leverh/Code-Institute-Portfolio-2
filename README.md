# Portfolio Assignment 2 - Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock: JavaScript Game Code

[Link to deployed website on github pages](https://leverh.github.io/Code-Institute-Portfolio-2/)

This small website contains a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

I tried to make this entire responsive website look fun utilizing special fonts, colors, and icons which should (at least- that was my intention) convey a playful easy going atmosphere. 

The target audience for the website are new coders (like myself) that want to be inspired by new ideas and methods to solve 'old' problems, or for the occasional player that just wants to try and beat the computer in their quest for rock paper scissors world domination!
